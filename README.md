# Adventure-Works-Sales

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from the Adventure Works dataset using Power BI. Adventure Works is a fictional company that sells bicycles and related products. The main objective of this project is to explore and visualize key sales metrics to gain insights into business performance. Using Power BI's interactive dashboards, we examined sales trends, top-performing products, customer demographics, regional performance, and profitability. The analysis helps in making data-driven decisions to boost sales, improve customer targeting, and optimize product offerings.

## Insights

 - Approximately $24.9 million in revenue was generated between January 2020 and June 2022, generating $10.5 million in profit.
 - Accessories account for the largest number of orders, specifically with tires and tubes being the most ordered product type. However, a large percentage of the total profit comes from bike sales.
 - Clothing has the highest return rate of all order categories, with shorts being the most returned item. However, an outlier in returns rates is the Road - 750 Black, 48 bike, which has a return rate of 4.23% which is significantly higher than other bikes. This would be worth investigating as a possible manufacturer defect associated with this bike that responsible for the higher than normal return rate.
 - Customer growth was fairly flat from January 2020 to July 2021 where is suddenly increased by almost 350 %. This could be attributed to a sale if it were only seen over one month, but seeing as that new customer number is maintained in proceed months, it's more likely that the spike in customer growth coincided with an event such as a new location opening.
 - While unique customer numbers have increased over this period of time, revenue per customer has been on a steady decline. This could be explained by several factors such as increased inflation as well has post-Covid manufacturing costs going up or product availability being less due to production constraints.
 - The largest spikes in revenue come in the month of December each year, with an average increase of 158 % over the previous month. This is likely due to the Christmas holiday.
