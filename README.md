# Adventure-Works-Sales

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from the Adventure Works dataset using Power BI. Adventure Works is a fictional company that sells bicycles and related products. The main objective of this project is to explore and visualize key sales metrics to gain insights into business performance. Using Power BI's interactive dashboards, we examined sales trends, top-performing products, customer demographics, regional performance, and profitability. The analysis helps in making data-driven decisions to boost sales, improve customer targeting, and optimize product offerings.
